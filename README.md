# riscv64-ghc-bindist

This repo provides binary distributions for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler for the RISC-V 64-bit instruction set architecture.
The released bindists are **unregisterised** builds cross-compiled from x86-64 and lack documentation and profiling libraries.
The intended purpose is to use them as a bootstrap compiler for a native build of GHC on RISC-V.
